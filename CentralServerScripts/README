MULTIPING SERVER
================

This TCP server tries to ping(8) all IP addresses listed in a file, and reports the result.

IP address file format: <ip_address><new_line>...
E.g.:
1.2.3.4
5.6.7.8
...

Response format: <date>;(Pass|Fail);<ip_address><new_line>...
E.g.:
Fri Apr 17 16:08:09 CEST 2015;Pass;1.2.3.4
Fri Apr 17 16:08:09 CEST 2015;Fail;5.6.7.8
...
The IP address response order is the same as in the IP address list file.
If you don't like the order, the change the file.i
(Or e.g. read the IP addresses from the TCP port instead, if you want to change them on the fly.)
